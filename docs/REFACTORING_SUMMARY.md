# Complete Statistics System Refactoring Summary

## 🎯 Goals Achieved

1. ✅ **Removed cache table** (`earnings_statistics`) and all intermediate entities
2. ✅ **Fixed overtime logic** - no more "all hours as overtime" bug
3. ✅ **Implemented Order-level aggregates** - single source of truth
4. ✅ **Real-time statistics** - calculated directly from source data

## 📦 Part 1: Cache Removal (STATISTICS_REFACTORING.md)

### Problem
- `earnings_statistics` table cached monthly data
- Updated only once per month via cron job
- Statistics returned empty arrays when cache was not populated
- Data inconsistency when orders/work_reports changed

### Solution
- Deleted `earnings-statistic.entity.ts`
- Removed all references from modules
- Removed scheduler job for cache updates
- Refactored all statistics methods to calculate in real-time

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/entities/earnings-statistic.entity.ts` - ❌ DELETED
- `backend/src/modules/statistics/statistics.service.ts` - removed cache logic
- `backend/src/modules/scheduler/scheduler.service.ts` - removed cron job
- All module imports updated

## 📊 Part 2: Overtime Fix (OVERTIME_FIX.md)

### Problem
```typescript
// WRONG:
workReport.isOvertime = (overtimeHours > 0);
// This marked ENTIRE report as overtime if ANY overtime hours present
```

**Result:** User entering 4h regular + 4h overtime = 8h ALL marked as overtime ❌

### Solution
- Use Order entity aggregate fields instead of work_report flags
- Separate `regularHours` and `overtimeHours` at Order level
- Statistics calculate from Order fields, not work_reports

### Architecture

**Order (Aggregate Root) - Single Source of Truth:**
```typescript
{
  regularHours: 4,          // ✅ Properly separated
  overtimeHours: 4,         // ✅ Properly separated
  calculatedAmount: 8000,   // Total engineer payment
  carUsageAmount: 1000,     // Car usage payment
  organizationPayment: 12000 // Organization payment
}
```

**WorkReport (Audit Trail / Event Log):**
- Multiple work_reports per order (history of work sessions)
- Each report contains: timestamps, photos, notes, location
- Data aggregates into Order for statistics and payments
- `isOvertime` field deprecated (kept for compatibility)
- **Purpose:** Audit trail, history, detailed breakdown for engineers/managers
- **Frontend:** Displayed in "Work Report" tab as list of all work sessions

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Work Report Creation Update

**File:** `backend/src/modules/orders/orders.service.ts`

```typescript
// After saving work_report:
order.regularHours += workReportData.regularHours;
order.overtimeHours += workReportData.overtimeHours;
order.calculatedAmount += totalPayment;
order.carUsageAmount += workReportData.carPayment;
order.organizationPayment += organizationPayment;
await this.ordersRepository.save(order);
```

### 2. Statistics Service Refactor

**File:** `backend/src/modules/statistics/statistics.service.ts`

**All methods now use Order aggregates:**
- `getAgentEarningsData()` - from `order.calculatedAmount + order.carUsageAmount`
- `getOrganizationEarningsData()` - from `order.organizationPayment`
- `getOvertimeStatisticsData()` - from `order.overtimeHours + order.regularHours`
- `getUserEarningsStatistics()` - from orders
- `getUserRankByEarnings()` - from orders
- `getEarningsComparison()` - from orders
- `getEngineerDetailedStats()` - from orders
- `getAdminEngineerStatistics()` - from orders

### 3. Data Migration

**File:** `backend/migrate-order-aggregates.js`

Aggregates existing work_reports into order fields.

**Execution:**
```bash
cd backend
node migrate-order-aggregates.js
```

**Result:**
```
✅ Order #6 "тестовый заказ": 0h regular + 31h overtime = 25600 RUB (3 work reports)
```

## 📈 Benefits

### Performance
- ✅ Faster queries (orders table instead of work_reports joins)
- ✅ Pre-aggregated data ready to use
- ✅ Fewer database queries

### Accuracy
- ✅ Real-time statistics (no stale cache)
- ✅ Correct regular/overtime separation
- ✅ Always reflects current data

### Maintainability
- ✅ Simpler architecture (no cache invalidation)
- ✅ Single source of truth (Order)
- ✅ Easier to understand and debug

### Scalability
- ✅ Modern databases handle aggregation efficiently
- ✅ Proper indexes on key fields
- ✅ No redundant cached data

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Database State After Migration:
```
Order #6:
  Regular hours: 0
  Overtime hours: 31  
  Payment: 21600 RUB
  Car: 4000 RUB
  Organization Payment: 30150 RUB
  Status: completed
```

### API Response:
```json

  "year": 2025,
  "month": 10,
  "agentEarnings": [
    {
      "agentId": 4,
      "totalEarnings": 25600,  // ✅ Correct sum
      "completedOrders": 1
    }
  ],
  "organizationEarnings": [
    {
      "organizationId": 1,
      "totalRevenue": 30150,   // ✅ From Order

      "totalProfit": 8550
    }
  ],
  "overtimeStatistics": [
    {
      "agentId": 4,
      "overtimeHours": 31,     // ✅ From Order aggregate
      "regularHours": 0,       // ✅ From Order aggregate
      "totalHours": 31
    }
  ]
}
```
